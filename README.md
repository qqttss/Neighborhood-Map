Neighborhood-Map:

A single-page application was developed using Javascript framework (knockout.js) and the third-party APIs. The website is a full-page map that loads with popular sites in New York City.

This project is hosted at: http://qqttss.github.io/Neighborhood-Map/

Run the application locally by opening index.html in your internet browser.

(or click search), the searched locations will be displayed on the map.

2. Click on any location in the list, an infomation box corresponding to the marker pops up and
